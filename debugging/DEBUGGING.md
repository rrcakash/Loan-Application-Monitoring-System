# Debugging Analysis

## Scenario 1: [Set User Role]

-   **Breakpoint Location:** [adminController.ts,Line 8]
-   **Objective:** [Investigate how roles are assigned to users and validate if the correct role is applied.]

### Debugger Observations

-   **Variable States:** [
   - uid: [Expected user ID]
    - role: [Expected role to be assigned]]
-   **Call Stack:** 
- API call to /admin/set-role

- Middleware authenticate verifies user authentication

- Middleware isAuthorized ensures only managers can assign roles

- setUserRole controller executes and sets custom user claims
-   **Behavior:** 

- The API correctly processes the request and assigns roles to the user.
- Any errors (e.g., invalid UID, missing role) trigger proper error responses.



### Analysis

- The function works well when a valid UID is provided.

- Unexpected behavior may occur if Firebase authentication fails.

- Consider adding more robust logging for debugging failed requests.

- Helps understand how user authentication and data retrieval work together.

## Scenario 2: [ Get User Details]

-   **Breakpoint Location:** [userController.ts, Line 10]
-   **Objective:** [Verify that the API correctly retrieves user details from Firebase]

### Debugger Observations

-   **Variable States:** [
   - uid: [Expected user ID]
    - role: [Returned user object or null]]
-   **Call Stack:** 
- API call to /user/:uid

- authenticate middleware verifies the request

- getUserDetails controller fetches the user details from Firebase

-   **Behavior:** 

- The API returns user details if the UID is valid.
- If the user does not exist, it correctly responds with a 404 error.

### Analysis
- The function works well when a valid UID is provided.

- Unexpected behavior may occur if Firebase authentication fails.

- Consider adding more robust logging for debugging failed requests.

- Helps understand how user authentication and data retrieval work together.



## Scenario 3: [Update Loan Status]
-   **Breakpoint Location:** [loanController.ts]
-   **Objective:** [Ensure the loan status update process correctly handles incoming requests.]

### Debugger Observations

-   **Variable States:** [
   - id: [Loan ID retrieved from request parameters]]

-   **Call Stack:** 
- API call to /loans/:id

- Middleware authenticate verifies user authentication

- updateLoanStatus controller retrieves and updates the loan
-   **Behavior:** 

- The request is successfully processed when a valid loan ID is provided.

- If the ID is missing or invalid, the response correctly handles errors.



### Analysis

- The function updates the loan status correctly when valid input is given.

- Adding a database check to confirm the loan exists before updating could improve reliability.

- Enhances understanding of how route parameters are processed in Express.
